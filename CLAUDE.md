# Family Meal Planner — Architecture Summary

Single-file HTML/JS app (`index.html`, ~4800 lines) for two people ("Him"/"Her") with nutrition tracking, shopping lists, package waste elimination, and cloud sync.

## Data Layer

- **NUTRI_DB** — ingredient database. Units: tbsp/cup/oz/each/slice/scoop (no tsp). Key flags: `halfSnap` (½ tbsp increments), `wholeOnly` (whole numbers only, eggs), `minAmt` (floor, e.g. beans 0.5 cup, ground meat 8 oz). `pkg` field for packaged items (cans, cartons, jars) with `drained`/`cups`/`size`/`unit`/`type`. `type:'bulk'` skips shopping display conversion.
- **MEALS[]** — recipes using `I(dbKey, amt, role, scalable)`. Single base amount per ingredient (no separate him/her). Calorie system scales per person. Roles: protein, carb, fat, veg, condiment, fruit, liquid, fixed.
- **DEFAULTS** — weekly meal assignments per person per slot.
- **CAL_BASE** — daily calorie targets (`{him:2800, her:1900}`).
- **SLOT_BUDGET** — `{breakfast:0.20, lunch:0.35, dinner:0.35, snack:0.10}` — percentage of (target - shake) for each slot.
- **OVERRIDES** — per person/day/slot ingredient amount overrides.
- **SKIPPED / EAT_OUT / LATE_SNACK** — state for skip, eat-out, late night snack.
- **ADJ_TARGETS** — per person/day checkboxes controlling which slots absorb redistributed calories.
- **SHARED_SCHEDULE** — per day/slot sharing and eat-out plan. Values: `'shared'`, `'skip-him'` (eat-out him), `'skip-her'` (eat-out her), `'skip-both'` (eat-out both), or absent (normal).
- **MANUAL_SET** — tracks which slots have been manually overridden by user actions.

## Key Helpers

- `sk(p,d,s)` — builds person_day_slot key (e.g. `'him_Monday_lunch'`)
- `dk(d,s)` — builds day_slot key (e.g. `'Monday_dinner'`)
- `pk(p,d)` — builds person_day key (e.g. `'him_Monday'`)
- `stampSel(key,mealId)` — sets SEL + timestamps in one call
- `updateSchedule()` — saves shared schedule + re-renders

## Slots

`['shake','breakfast','lunch','snack','dinner','late_snack']`

- **shake** — fixed, not in ADJ_SLOTS, not adjustable. If skipped, its calories redistribute to all checked slots.
- **breakfast/lunch/snack/dinner** — adjustable via budget system.
- **late_snack** — manual entry (name + macros), optional add-on.

## Budget-Based Calorie System

Each slot independently targets a calorie budget:
```
budget = (CAL_BASE[person] - shakeKcal) × SLOT_BUDGET[slot]
```

`computeSlotBudgets(p, d)` handles redistribution when slots are skipped or eat-out.

## Unified Ingredient System

Single base `amt` per ingredient (not separate him/her). The calorie adjustment system (`adjustIngredients`) scales meals per person to hit their slot budget. Both people start from the same recipe.

## Package Waste Elimination

Zero-waste system across the full pipeline:

1. **Randomizer Phase 1**: Anchors package meals (beans, coconut milk, marinara, tofu, ground meats) into shared-schedule slots as shared + leftover pairs.
2. **Phase 2**: Fills remaining slots with non-package meals only.
3. **Phase 3**: Replaces unpaired package meals in shared slots.
4. **Final**: Enforces shared schedule (runs absolutely last).
5. **Shopping optimizer**: Scales trip totals to clean package boundaries. Per-ingredient flex ranges (beans/marinara +100%, coconut +75%). Equal portions for shared meals.
6. **Retry loop**: Re-randomizes up to 10 times until zero waste achieved.
7. **`minAmt`**: Prevents calorie adjuster from zeroing out packaged ingredients (beans 0.5 cup, coconut 0.25 cup, tofu 7 oz, ground meats 8 oz).
8. **Waste warnings**: Amber "⚠️ ½ can unused" on shopping list items with any remaining waste.

## Schedule Meals (Meal Planning UI)

Collapsible panel with 7×3 grid (Mon-Sun × Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner):

- **Split pills**: Him/Her halves per cell. Tap toggles eat-out, long press toggles shared.
- **States**: Normal (gray), Shared (green), Eat-out him/her/both (red).
- **Manual Set**: Purple indicator for slots manually overridden. Schedule grid locked for manually-set slots.
- **Day toggle**: Tap Mon-Sun label cycles whole day (normal → shared → eat-out → normal).
- **Presets**: B/L/D buttons with 3-zone click (left=him eat-out, center=shared, right=her eat-out).
- **Set button**: Locks current schedule as manual overrides.
- **Clear button**: Clears all manual sets with confirm popup.
- **Painting mode**: Select slot + meal, tap cells to queue, Assign to apply.

## Randomizer

`randomizeWeek()` with retry wrapper → `_randomizeWeekCore()`:

- **Pre-phase**: Clears old skips, locks eat-out slots, applies schedule eat-outs.
- **Phase 1**: Anchors package meals into shared-schedule slots with leftover pairing. Cap: 3 per trip.
- **Phase 2**: Fills remaining slots with non-package meals. 2-day buffer prevents repeats (including cross-week from last week data).
- **Phase 3**: Replaces unpaired package meals in shared slots with non-package alternatives.
- **Final**: Enforces shared schedule — all `'shared'` slots get matching him/her meals.
- **Trip optimization**: `optimizeTripWaste()` tries random swaps within Mon-Wed and Thu-Sun trips.
- **Randomize popup**: Him/Her toggles to choose who to randomize.

## 3-Week View

- **Last / This Week / Next**: Three week pills. Auto-rollover shifts last←this←next.
- **Last week**: Amber banner "View Only". No randomize button. Manual edits still possible.
- **Next week**: Blue banner "Planning Ahead". Fully editable.
- **Rollover**: Clears all manual overrides (skips, eat-outs, overrides, late snacks) for the new week.

## UI Pills (top row of each meal card)

- **Leftovers** (amber) — auto, not clickable. Shows when meal is a leftover.
- **Big Cook** (amber) — auto, not clickable. Shows on cook day.
- **Set** (purple) — auto, not clickable. Shows when slot is manually overridden.
- **Shared** (green) — toggle for shared cooking.
- **Skip** (grey) — toggle. Sets MANUAL_SET. Eat Out visible when skipped.
- **Eat Out** (red) — toggle. Sets MANUAL_SET. Overrides skip.

## Macro Display

- Stats bar: kcal (person color) / protein (person color) / carbs (green) / fat (yellow)
- Macro bar: P/C/F colored segments. Her tab uses pink (#F472B6) for protein.
- Meals tab color: blue (Him), pink (Her), green (Shared).

## Shopping

- `buildShoppingList()` aggregates ingredients per trip (Mon-Wed, Thu-Sun).
- Package optimizer scales totals to clean package boundaries with per-ingredient flex ranges.
- Equal split for shared meals (same pot = same portions).
- `shopQtyWithCount()` converts to package counts. `type:'bulk'` skips conversion.
- Waste warnings on any remaining package waste.
- Both view shows combined totals only (no him/her split).

## Recipes Tab

Three collapsible sections:
- **New Recipe**: Compact form with slot/person chips, bordered ingredient list, steps textarea.
- **New Ingredient**: 2-row compact form (Name/Unit/Role + Kcal/Pro/Fat/Carb).
- **Edit Recipes**: Slot/meal picker with inline preview. Edit mode shows quantity dropdowns. Assign saves as custom override (clones built-in meals).

## Cloud Sync

JSONBlob-based push/pull with timestamp merge. Syncs weekData (all 3 weeks), customMeals, customIngredients, eatOutDB, SHARED_SCHEDULE.
